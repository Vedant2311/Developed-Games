This game was developed by the **Game Development Club IITD** for the [Game Development World Championship (GDWC)](https://thegdwc.com/) 2018. This Android game was based on the idea of a Temple-Run types infinite runner platform, but rather than just being based on simply running through the same scene indefinitely, we included a set of scenes with different types of obstacles etc as well as various powerups which would teleport the player to some dark unknown scene or make him fly or make him enter some survival mode etc.
