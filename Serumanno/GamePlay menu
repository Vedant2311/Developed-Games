Despite of having so many temptations and deviations in life, you have to stay focused by resisting all the unjust and immoral temptations and achieve your goals which will ultimately lead you to a happy and respectable life.//

STORY(2)
//But it's completely upto you to keep yourself safe from these social evils which are trying to attack you and preventing you from reaching a safe point of a healthy heart, mind, and body! The time is frozen and so is the entire population of your city excluding you! So, you have to fight all these evils alone and save your people from their internal demons!//

GAME FLOW(1)
//This game has a total of 6 levels. You have to start from a particular point in the city and have to reach some hidden points in your city safely but tackling all temptations in the form of game obstacles to help someone stuck in a confusing situation. But keep in mind that you don't have much time left and so you have to act as quick as you can to reach to the most ethical correct alternative out of 4 or 5 options else you will lose :( //

GAME FLOW(2)
//The levels progress as you help people. With each progressing level, you will have to act quicker, dodge more internal obstacles (fighting your conscience), and situational questions will keep getting more and more difficult! The spot to reach will be marked by a Golden glowing circle. You will also be able to take the help of an anti-gravity zone, marked by a bright blue circle, which will raise you in the sky for three seconds during which you can try to locate the golden spot!//

GAME FLOW(3)
//Once you reach the golden spot, you will be sent to a different universe to help that person. There you will be given the situation of that person and you will help that person being someone else whom he trusts! You will have to choose one of many choices available to you, such that both that person can tackle the situation in the best possible way! Thus, choosing a proper option, you end up being a hero, saving people in their most difficult times//

SCORING
//The quicker you reach, the better decision you make, and the higher the level of difficulty is, the more you score! If you are unable to save yourself from the internal evils, attacking you in the form of rocks falling from the sky symbolising false temptations like drugs, alcohol, gadget misuse etc or high speed objects trying to attack you on the road, you will lose and the game will be over :( Also making really bad decision will eliminate you :(//
