// Some of the MCQ Questions that would be asked in the game.

Vedant:
1) You are driving fast to the hospital since you got a call that your mom met with an accident and is unconsious now. 
   But, in this situation of haste, worry, and panic, you drive recklessly and hit someone and the impact seems pretty strong.
   The time is around 2:00 AM and there is no one other than you two. You stop the car just at the impact. You are horribly scared now! 
   At this instant, you have the following options. What would you choose-
      1) Get out of the car and see if he's okay or not. And if he's unconsious, then just leave this place since anyone no one will ever know that this person died due to you!
      2) Just drive ahead since you don't know how much time does your mom have, without worrying about this man!
      3) Take the man along with you, but remember that in your country there is death penalty for deaths caused by accidents due to reckless driving! So there is a risk that that person is dead!
      4) Call an ambulance from his phone(so that you remain anonymous) and leave the place, so that if that person is dead then you won't have to face a death penalty!
           
 2) You are an arrogant professor with a great amount of ego. You are known to impose very strict punishments on students for slightest of their mistakes.
    Just like always, you find a student copying even this time, during the final exam. You scold him and ask him to hand you over the answer script and leave the place.
    But, he refuses to do so. So, you snatch his paper away and tear it into pieces. That boy is teary eyed now and writes something on the rough sheet, crumbles it, throws it somewhere in the class, and then leaves.
    You go to that crumbled paper, open it, and find a threat for suicide! What will you do now?
      1) Assume that he's lying and trying to manipulate you and so don't do anything.
      2) Run out of the classroom, looking for that boy, putting aside all the ego and arrogance that you have against the students!
      3) Complaint the security head about this matter and then don't give a damn about him
      4) Contact the police and suicide prevention helpline and give his details. 

 3) You are a huge marvel fan and have been waiting for months for endgame to release. But it releases during your exam which is supposed to last for around 10 days.
    Because of your busy schedule, you are unable to meet your gf(who doesn't like marvel at all) for around three weeks. Meanwhile, you also fought on phone and are on a break till the exams end!
    And she's leaving for her home after the exams. So, you will be able to meet her only after the exams end. What will you choose?-
      1) Watch the movie with your friends since she badly misbehaved with you that night and so convert that "break" into a "break-up"!
      2) Convince her somehow to watch movie with you and if she says no, then go for the movie with your friends, since she never agrees to the things that make you feel good!
      3) Forget the movie, keep aside your ego, hope that everything goes fine (and be ready for a possible heartbreak), and take her for a dinner date.
      4) Forget the movie and the date, talk to your mom rather since you haven't talked for around a month and she deserves your love and affection.
      
 4) Your parents are coming to stay with you from tomorrow, after a year, and they wish that you come to pick them up at some 8:00 AM at the airport. 
    But, your bf (about whom they don't know) is going through tough times recently and is on anti-depressants. 
    He plans to talk to his psychiatrist tomorrow about some childhood traumas which have been haunting him for years, and you both think that it's the reason for his depression and suicidal tendencies.
    You receive his call at 1:00 AM, when you are just about to go to sleep. He is crying badly and needs you badly with him today. He's unable to sleep and reveals you that he has been considering suicide since the last three weeks!
    What will you do now? - 
      1) Tell him that your parents are more important than him, since they have raised you and given their love and support to you for 25 years, while he's in your life only for one year!
      2) Talk to your bf or go to his appartment till he feels nice, and then prepare some surprise for your parents, and then reach airport at 7:45 AM, ignoring your sleep
      3) Text a fake story to your parents that a friend of yours met with an accident and so you won't be able to pick them, and then go to your bf and be with him till his counselling session.
      4) Ignore the bf and your parents and complete your sleep rather, since you have had a tough time in the office recently and aren't feeling nice due to lack of sleep.   
      5) Tell your parents everything (who are pretty strict with regards to these things) and bring your bf with you, so that you can spend time with your parents as well as provide support to your bf.

 5) Suppose you are working hard on some home work for 3 days and suddenly at the night of submission, your best friend asks you for the complete assignment since he was unable to work till now because of his depression.
    What will you do now?
      1) Give him the assignment since he is depressed and your bestie as well
      2) Don't give because you worked really hard for this and you don't want your hard work to be copied
      3) Don't give because you are afraid of the punishment if you are caught
      4) Don't give him but rather talk to him now and make him comfortable enough to tell you about his emotional health and try to persuade him to go to a counsellor
