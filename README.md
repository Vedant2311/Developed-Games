# Developed-Games

Some important notes for these scripts:

- These are just some codes and are not going to do anything by simply adding them in Unity
- Not ALL the scripts for the games are included
- The animations, textures, buildings etc. were imported from the Unity Asset store
- Some simple sprites were made using tools like Paint and Photoshop
- The files of these games are not included here because of size limits
- The games are not out yet! You can feel free to contact me to get a beta version
